# Task 1: 𝑪𝒂𝒆𝒔𝒂𝒓 𝑪𝒊𝒑𝒉𝒆𝒓 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒎

## Overview

This Python program implements the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm, which allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text by shifting the characters in the message.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value.
- **User Input**: Enter your own message and specify the shift value for the cipher.
- **Clear Instructions**: Follow easy-to-understand prompts to guide you through the process.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to start the Caesar Cipher program.

2. **Select Action**: Choose 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption.

3. **Enter Message**: Input the message you wish to process.

4. **Specify Shift**: Enter the shift value for the Caesar Cipher.

5. **View Result**: The program displays the encrypted or decrypted message.



# Task 2: 𝑰𝒎𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝑬𝒏𝒄𝒓𝒚𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑻𝒐𝒐𝒍

This Python program implements a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing basic mathematical operations on pixel values. The program is designed to be user-friendly, guiding users through the encryption and decryption processes with clear prompts.

## Features

- **Image Encryption**: Encrypt an image by applying a mathematical operation to each pixel value, effectively altering the image.
- **Image Decryption**: Reverse the encryption process to restore the original image.
- **User Input**: Specify the image file and the encryption key.
- **File Handling**: Save the encrypted and decrypted images to specified file paths.

## How It Works

- **Encrypt Image**: Multiplies each pixel value by a key and then divides by the key plus one to create the encrypted image.
- **Decrypt Image**: Reverses the encryption process by multiplying each pixel value by the key plus one and then dividing by the key.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to start the Image Encryption Tool.

2. **Select Action**: Choose 'e' for encryption, 'd' for decryption, or 'q' to quit.

3. **Encrypt Image**:
   - Enter the encryption key.
   - Specify the location or URL of the image to be encrypted.

4. **Decrypt Image**:
   - Enter the decryption key.
   - Specify the location of the encrypted image.

5. **View Results**: The program saves and indicates the location of the encrypted and decrypted images.



# Task 3: 𝑷𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒅 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒙𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝑪𝒉𝒆𝒄𝒌𝒆𝒓

This Python program evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria, offering users feedback on how secure their passwords are. It provides tips for creating strong passwords and underscores the importance of various password components.

## Features

- **Password Strength Assessment**: Checks for length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in the password.
- **Feedback on Password Strength**: Provides a message indicating whether the password is very strong, strong, moderate, or weak.
- **Password Masking**: Masks the password input for privacy before displaying it.
- **Security Tips**: Offers advice on creating secure passwords and maintaining good password hygiene.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to start the Password Complexity Checking Tool.

2. **Read Tips**: Review the provided tips for creating a secure password.

3. **Enter Password**: Input the password you wish to check.

4. **View Feedback**: The program displays the masked password and provides feedback on its strength.



# Task 4: 𝑲𝒆𝒚𝒍𝒐𝒈𝒈𝒆𝒓

This Python program implements a basic keylogger that records and logs keystrokes. It captures the keys pressed by the user and saves them to a log file, serving as an educational tool for understanding how keylogging works. This program includes ethical considerations and requires user consent before running.

## Features

- **Key Logging**: Records and logs every keystroke along with a timestamp.
- **Log File**: Saves the logged keystrokes to a specified file.
- **User Consent**: Includes a disclaimer and requires user acceptance of terms and conditions.
- **Duration Control**: Allows the user to specify the duration for which the keystrokes should be logged.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to start the keylogger program.

2. **Read and Accept Disclaimer**: Carefully read the disclaimer and accept the terms and conditions to proceed.

3. **Specify Duration**: Enter the duration in seconds for which the keylogger should run.

4. **Logging Keystrokes**: The program will capture and log keystrokes during the specified period.

5. **Review Log**: After the duration ends, the log file containing the keystrokes will be saved, and its location will be displayed.
